At the opposite side of the grid create a smaller area for the rondo to take place as pictured in the diagram.<\/p>\n<p>Divide players into two groups. One larger numbered group to play keep away with a smaller group to serve as defenders. For the rondo portion 4v2 is a good number to work with, however, this could also work with 3v1, 5v2, 6v2, 6v3, 7v3, etc. The defending group also has one player waiting outside of the rondo area to defend against an oncoming attack.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;3.27.4&#8243; text_font=&#8221;|300|||||||&#8221; text_text_color=&#8221;#151516&#8243; max_width=&#8221;70%&#8221; max_width_tablet=&#8221;&#8221; max_width_phone=&#8221;&#8221; max_width_last_edited=&#8221;on|desktop&#8221; module_alignment=&#8221;center&#8221;]<\/p>\n<h3>How It Works<\/h3>\n<p>This drill begins just like a normal rondo where the team in possession plays keep away from the defenders in the rondo area of the grid. Once the attackers complete a minimum number of passes or hold on to the ball for a certain amount of time, they can attack towards the large goal and try to score.<\/p>\n<p>When attacking, three attacking players can enter the attacking area where as the rondo defenders can only bring one more. Since one defender is already in the attacking area this creates a 3v2 situation. Other variations can be played by tweaking the number of attackers or defenders allowed into this area. Adjustments can be made accordingly depending on the skill level of the players.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;3.27.4&#8243; text_font=&#8221;|300|||||||&#8221; text_text_color=&#8221;#151516&#8243; max_width=&#8221;70%&#8221; max_width_tablet=&#8221;&#8221; max_width_phone=&#8221;&#8221; max_width_last_edited=&#8221;on|desktop&#8221; module_alignment=&#8221;center&#8221;]<\/p>\n<h3>Coaching Points<\/h3>\n<p>In essence this drill combines aspects of both a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/blog\/rondo-drills\/\">rondo<\/a> and a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/blog\/finishing-drills\/\">finishing drill<\/a>. It can be used to help players work on possession play but also going forward and trying to score.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to keeping possession, movement off the ball and offering good passing angles is key. The size of the rondo area can be adjusted to provide varying levels of difficulty. A small tight area is tougher on the team in possession where as more space typically gives players more time on the ball.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n<span class=\"et_bloom_bottom_trigger\"><\/span>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Rondo to attack is a fun rondo &#8216;keep away&#8217; variation where once players have completed a certain number of passes they can go forward and try to score.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":49773,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_et_pb_use_builder":"on","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":""},"categories":[23,22,19,26,17],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/49772"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=49772"}],"version-history":[{"count":7,"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/49772\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":50289,"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/49772\/revisions\/50289"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/49773"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=49772"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=49772"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=49772"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
