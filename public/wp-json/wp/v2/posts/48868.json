When you think about it, coaches have a lot of responsibilities from organizing trainings, developing game plans, communicating with players, and much more. When it comes down to it though, successful coaches share some crucial common attributes which set them apart from the rest.<\/p>\n<p>So what\u2019s the secret?<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the thing, often times people tend to focus on the tactical or strategic aspects of what makes coaches great. But consider this, according to inspirational speaker Tony Robbins, only 20% of an individual\u2019s success is due to strategies and tactics! In fact, 80% of an individual\u2019s success is determined by their psychology. As a coach, having the right attitude and mindset is essential for inspiring players, developing the team, and creating a winning culture.<\/p>\n<p>In this article we\u2019ll take a look at five qualities of successful football coaches that you can incorporate immediately to develop a winning psychology within your organization. What\u2019s more these qualities are not only applicable to coaching football, they are cornerstones for success in other sports, business, and more. When a coach embodies these traits, it has a cumulative effect by rubbing off on those around them as players tend to emulate the characteristics of their leader. So let\u2019s jump in and see how you can get started developing an atmosphere that breeds success.<\/p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column_inner][\/et_pb_row_inner][et_pb_row_inner _builder_version=&#8221;3.25&#8243;][et_pb_column_inner saved_specialty_column_type=&#8221;3_4&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;3.25&#8243; custom_padding=&#8221;|||&#8221; custom_padding__hover=&#8221;|||&#8221;][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;3.27.4&#8243; text_font=&#8221;||||||||&#8221; text_text_color=&#8221;rgba(47,50,54,0.8)&#8221; link_option_url_new_window=&#8221;on&#8221;]<h3>1. Create A Positive Team Culture<\/h3>\n<p>First things first, never underestimate the power of positivity. One of the things that sets successful individuals apart from those who fail is their unwavering belief in their ability to achieve their goals. Having belief in oneself is critical to achieving just about anything in life.<\/p>\n<p>Think about this, if someone doesn\u2019t believe in themselves, why would they go the extra mile to try to reach their goal? If they don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to make it regardless of what they do, they\u2019re less likely to take the actions necessary to succeed. On the other hand, true believers take massive action and go the extra mile. They don\u2019t stop until they reach their final goal because all along the way they never questioned their ability to succeed.<\/p>\n<p>As a coach it\u2019s important to instill this attitude of belief into your players and the best way to do this is by cultivating a positive team environment. Having a positive attitude and belief in your team is not only contagious to those around you, but it\u2019s vital to helping your team reach it\u2019s full potential.<\/p>\n<p>Consider this, most people respond better to praise than they do from criticism. Focusing on what people do well builds enthusiasm and optimism. In fact, according to the <a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2013\/03\/the-ideal-praise-to-criticism\">Harvard Business Review<\/a>, the ideal praise to criticism ratio is five good things for every one piece of criticism or feedback. Although pointing out what\u2019s wrong is necessary for players to grow and improve, it is much better received when players are enveloped in a positive team culture where they get a lot of positive feedback as well. In an environment such as this, players are more likely to take corrections in a constructive way to improve their game rather than take it personally.<\/p>\n<p>The first step to creating a positive team culture is to lead with positivity and to set the tone as a coach. Always try to focus on the good and praise players for what they do well. This is key to making your players feel confident, accept your ideas, and become the best they can be.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>\u2018I try to be positive.

Focus On Building Strong Relationships<\/h3>\n<p>The simple truth is, coaches have to win the trust of those around them in order to lead effectively. Trust is developed over time when a coach continuously shows they care. Good coaches model the behavior they expect from their team and in turn earn the respect and admiration of their players.<\/p>\n<p>With this in mind, a few ways to cultivate positive relationships is by being accessible and easy to communicate with, listening to what players have to say, and giving each individual the attention they need to grow and develop.<\/p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column_inner][\/et_pb_row_inner][et_pb_row_inner column_structure=&#8221;1_2,1_2&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;3.25&#8243;][et_pb_column_inner type=&#8221;1_2&#8243; saved_specialty_column_type=&#8221;3_4&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;3.25&#8243; custom_padding=&#8221;|||&#8221; custom_padding__hover=&#8221;|||&#8221;][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;4.4.3&#8243; text_font=&#8221;||||||||&#8221; text_text_color=&#8221;rgba(47,50,54,0.8)&#8221; text_font_size=&#8221;18px&#8221; text_line_height=&#8221;1.5em&#8221; header_2_font=&#8221;|300|||||||&#8221; header_2_font_size=&#8221;40px&#8221; header_2_line_height=&#8221;1.1em&#8221; custom_margin=&#8221;|||&#8221; custom_padding_tablet=&#8221;|||18px&#8221; custom_padding_phone=&#8221;&#8221; custom_padding_last_edited=&#8221;on|desktop&#8221; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; text_font_size_tablet=&#8221;&#8221; text_font_size_phone=&#8221;&#8221; text_font_size_last_edited=&#8221;on|tablet&#8221; text_line_height_tablet=&#8221;1.7em&#8221; text_line_height_phone=&#8221;1.7em&#8221; text_line_height_last_edited=&#8221;on|desktop&#8221; header_2_font_size_tablet=&#8221;30px&#8221; header_2_font_size_phone=&#8221;&#8221; header_2_font_size_last_edited=&#8221;on|desktop&#8221;]<p>Trying to make everyone happy can be one of the hardest aspects of being a coach, especially when competing at higher levels and issues of positions and playing time rise to the surface. This is where communication is extremely important. Every player on the team has a role to play no matter how big or how small. Let players know what their role is and how they can best help the team succeed. Those with true team spirit not only have a genuine consideration for others, but an eagerness to sacrifice personal interests for the glory and welfare of all.<\/p>\n<p>But let\u2019s make this clear, just because an individual is a team player doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t looking to improve and take on a larger role within the team.

The Power of A Growth Mindset<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Ever wonder why some individuals are extremely driven and motivated while others don\u2019t seem to push themselves at all? Much of this can explained by a concept Carol Dweck explains in her book \u2018Mindset\u2019. If you are unfamiliar with <a href=\"https:\/\/fs.blog\/2015\/03\/carol-dweck-mindset\/\">Dweck\u2019s research<\/a>, let me break it down for you. Dweck describes that there are two types of mindsets- growth and fixed. Essentially, people with growth mindsets believe that talent and intelligence are not fixed traits. On the other hand, fixed minded individuals believe that people are born with talent and that our potential is predetermined.<\/p>\n<p>To put this another way, growth minded individuals attribute success to the result of persistence and effort rather than luck. Naturally the type of mindset we have can have a huge effect on our overall psychology such as how we approach challenges, handle adversity, and respond to feedback.<\/p>\n<p>People with growth mindsets aren\u2019t afraid to take on new challenges because they realize if they fail, it\u2019s an opportunity for growth. They also realize that hard work and persistence are key to achieving their goals and don\u2019t take setbacks personally.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>\u2018Sometimes, it is good to lose \u2013 you learn.\u2019 &#8211; Thomas Tuchel<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As a coach, embracing a growth mindset is key to seeing the potential in all of one\u2019s players. A growth minded coach knows that every player on their team can learn, grow, and improve, even the ones that may not seem physically or technically gifted. Coach with the attitude that all of your players have the potential to make dramatic improvements, believe in them, and inspire them to reach for greatness. Instilling this mentality into your players will encourage them to work hard, pursue their goals, and never give up.<\/p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column_inner][\/et_pb_row_inner][et_pb_row_inner _builder_version=&#8221;3.25&#8243;][et_pb_column_inner saved_specialty_column_type=&#8221;3_4&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;3.25&#8243; custom_padding=&#8221;|||&#8221; custom_padding__hover=&#8221;|||&#8221;][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;3.27.4&#8243; text_font=&#8221;||||||||&#8221; text_text_color=&#8221;rgba(47,50,54,0.8)&#8221; link_option_url_new_window=&#8221;on&#8221;]<h3><strong>4. The Importance of Teamwork<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Top coaches foster a sense of teamwork in their organization in two major ways. First, they have high emotional intelligence and build strong relationships with those around them- but you already knew that because you read point number two. Secondly, they have a clear vision that they communicate with their team.<\/p>\n<p>As a coach it\u2019s important to get everyone in your organization to buy in to your vision. When all of your players are on the same page, harnessing the power of teamwork can have a synergistic effect where the output becomes greater than the sum of the individual parts.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes teams with extremely talented individuals make the mistake of relying too heavily on individual players. Organizations with a strong team-oriented culture are unfazed even if one of their top players isn\u2019t having their best performance. The importance of a single individual should never detract from your team\u2019s overall mission. Together everyone achieves more.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>\u2018The target for every great champion is to play for the team.\u2019 -Antonio Conte<\/em><\/p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column_inner][\/et_pb_row_inner][et_pb_row_inner _builder_version=&#8221;3.25&#8243;][et_pb_column_inner saved_specialty_column_type=&#8221;3_4&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;3.25&#8243; custom_padding=&#8221;|||&#8221; custom_padding__hover=&#8221;|||&#8221;][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;3.27.4&#8243; text_font=&#8221;||||||||&#8221; text_text_color=&#8221;rgba(47,50,54,0.8)&#8221; link_option_url_new_window=&#8221;on&#8221;]<h3><strong>5. Remember That Enthusiasm Is Contagious<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>When you truly love what you are doing it brushes off on those around you. This is why it\u2019s so important to enjoy the process and the day to day tasks of coaching. Always remember that success takes time and that if you are expecting instant results, you\u2019re bound to be disappointed. Through following good habits repeated again and again, you\u2019re sure to achieve the goals you set out to conquer. Even though it\u2019s important to have a final destination in mind, great coaches take every opportunity to enjoy the journey along the way. When you\u2019re passionate about what you\u2019re doing, not only will you be having a better time, but you\u2019ll also work harder, longer, and use every day as an opportunity to get better without even realizing it.<\/p>\n<p>Always look for new ways to grow and improve, have patience, and be grateful for the opportunity to coach the beautiful game.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>\u2019It needs time.
