In the diagram here there are two goals on each side and an &#8216;all-time-offense&#8217; neutral player shown in red. Having a neutral player is also optional.<\/p>\n<p>Divide players into two teams and number the players off so that each player has a number. Position the players on one side of the grid and be ready to get them going with a supply of balls.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;4.2.2&#8243; text_font=&#8221;|300|||||||&#8221; text_text_color=&#8221;#151516&#8243; max_width=&#8221;70%&#8221; max_width_tablet=&#8221;&#8221; max_width_phone=&#8221;&#8221; max_width_last_edited=&#8221;on|desktop&#8221; module_alignment=&#8221;center&#8221; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243;]<\/p>\n<h3>How It Works<\/h3>\n<p>The coach plays a ball into the grid and calls out several numbers. The corresponding players representing these numbers come out and compete against each other to try to score a goal. If a coach calls two numbers, the drill becomes 2v2. However, this could also work with 1v1, 3v3, 4v4, etc.<\/p>\n<p>When the ball goes out of play the players go back to the start position and the coach calls all out new numbers.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;4.2.2&#8243; text_font=&#8221;|300|||||||&#8221; text_text_color=&#8221;#151516&#8243; max_width=&#8221;70%&#8221; max_width_tablet=&#8221;&#8221; max_width_phone=&#8221;&#8221; max_width_last_edited=&#8221;on|desktop&#8221; module_alignment=&#8221;center&#8221; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243;]<\/p>\n<h3>Coaching Points<\/h3>\n<p>Players need to constantly be on their toes and ready as they won&#8217;t know which numbers will get called before hand.<\/p>\n<p>The starting position of the players can also have an impact on this drill. For a more defensive emphasis have players start at their own end lines. To promote competition and winning 50-50 balls, players can be positioned on the same side line as shown in the diagram here.<\/p>\n<p>Having a neutral player in the drill helps promote offensive play as the team in possession always has one extra person to help them keep the ball and go forward.<\/p>\n<p>Coaches can emphasize awareness, teamwork, and communication in this drill. Tactical considerations may vary from coach to coach depending on their strategic preferences and goals for their team.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n<span class=\"et_bloom_bottom_trigger\"><\/span>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Call the numbers is a dynamic small sided game where the players who come out and compete are the numbers that the coach calls out.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":50403,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_et_pb_use_builder":"on","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":""},"categories":[22,17],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/50402"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=50402"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/50402\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":50411,"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/50402\/revisions\/50411"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/50403"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=50402"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=50402"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=50402"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
