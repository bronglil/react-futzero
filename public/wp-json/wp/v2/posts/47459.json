Once the offensive team has completed a minimum of four passes in a row they can enter the middle neutral area and attempt a long shot on goal. If a goal is scored or the ball goes out of play a new ball starts with the attacking team on the opposing side.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;3.27.4&#8243; text_font=&#8221;|300|||||||&#8221; text_text_color=&#8221;#151516&#8243; max_width=&#8221;70%&#8221; max_width_tablet=&#8221;&#8221; max_width_phone=&#8221;&#8221; max_width_last_edited=&#8221;on|desktop&#8221; module_alignment=&#8221;center&#8221;]<\/p>\n<h3>Coaching Points<\/h3>\n<p>This drill gives players a chance to practice finishing from distance because they are able to shoot uncontested once they make it into the middle neutral area. In addition, it&#8217;s also a nice way for players to work on moving the ball around while under pressure from a defender. In essence it combines aspects of both a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/blog\/rondo-drills\/\">rondo<\/a> and a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/blog\/finishing-drills\/\">finishing drill<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>One thing to be on the lookout for is that offensive players are moving to create good passing angles for their teammates when they don&#8217;t have the ball.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n<span class=\"et_bloom_bottom_trigger\"><\/span>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The 3v1 long range shooting game is a fun exercise where teams can enter a neutral area for a long shot after completing a minimum number of passes.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":47460,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_et_pb_use_builder":"on","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":""},"categories":[23,17],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/47459"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=47459"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/47459\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":50339,"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/47459\/revisions\/50339"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/47460"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=47459"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=47459"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=47459"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
