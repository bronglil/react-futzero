In order to do this drill, every player needs a soccer ball.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;3.27.4&#8243; text_font=&#8221;|300|||||||&#8221; text_text_color=&#8221;#151516&#8243; max_width=&#8221;70%&#8221; max_width_tablet=&#8221;&#8221; max_width_phone=&#8221;&#8221; max_width_last_edited=&#8221;on|desktop&#8221; module_alignment=&#8221;center&#8221;]<\/p>\n<h3>How It Works<\/h3>\n<p>In this drill players earn points by dribbling through the various sets of cones spread out around the field. In order to work on dribbling at pace, the coach can set a time limit and the players count how many sets of cones they can dribble through. The player who dribbles through the most cones wins. Keep in mind players should not dribble through the same set of cones twice, this way they have to move around the grid and dribble through different sets of cones.<\/p>\n<p>When using this as a warm-up exercise, have players start more slowly at their own pace before moving to the competition phase of this drill. This is important to avoid injury as it is not a good idea to have players dribbling at top speed without warming up first.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;3.27.4&#8243; text_font=&#8221;|300|||||||&#8221; text_text_color=&#8221;#151516&#8243; max_width=&#8221;70%&#8221; max_width_tablet=&#8221;&#8221; max_width_phone=&#8221;&#8221; max_width_last_edited=&#8221;on|desktop&#8221; module_alignment=&#8221;center&#8221;]<\/p>\n<h3>Coaching Points<\/h3>\n<p>Coaches should be sure that players are using proper technique while dribbling. When dribbling at speed the outside of the foot should be used. Also check to see if players keep their heads up to see what is around them.<\/p>\n<p>To add variations to this exercise coaches can put stipulations on the players such as &#8216;left foot only&#8217;, &#8216;right foot only&#8217;, or using different locomotions such as skipping or hopping during the warm-up phase.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n<span class=\"et_bloom_bottom_trigger\"><\/span>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The speedy dribbling warm-up is a way to get players moving and practicing dribbling skills, ideally at the start of practice.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":4833,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_et_pb_use_builder":"on","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":""},"categories":[25,17,18],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4832"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4832"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4832\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":50360,"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4832\/revisions\/50360"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/4833"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4832"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4832"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4832"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
