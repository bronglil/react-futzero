An ideal distance is approximately 10m in total, however, this may vary depending on the age of the players. In addition, place two goals faceing the dribbling area 5-10m behind the start cone. Once the grid is set up, separate players into even teams. If some teams have an extra player the teams with fewer players will have to assign someone to perform two legs of the relay, this way all teams perform the same number of relay legs. Each player needs a ball.<\/p>\n[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;4.4.3&#8243; text_font=&#8221;|300|||||||&#8221; text_text_color=&#8221;#151516&#8243; max_width=&#8221;70%&#8221; max_width_tablet=&#8221;&#8221; max_width_phone=&#8221;&#8221; max_width_last_edited=&#8221;on|desktop&#8221; module_alignment=&#8221;center&#8221; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243;]<h3>How It Works<\/h3>\n<p>On the coaches signal players dribble as fast as they can around the final cone, turn around, and dribble back towards their line. Once they&#8217;ve made it all the way, they play a pass into the goal and then sit down to signify that they have completed their relay leg. The first team to complete all of their relay legs and have all their players sitting down wins. For every pass that missed the goal a team can be penalized several seconds.<\/p>\n[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;4.4.3&#8243; text_font=&#8221;|300|||||||&#8221; text_text_color=&#8221;#151516&#8243; max_width=&#8221;70%&#8221; max_width_tablet=&#8221;&#8221; max_width_phone=&#8221;&#8221; max_width_last_edited=&#8221;on|desktop&#8221; module_alignment=&#8221;center&#8221; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243;]<h3>Coaching Points<\/h3>\n<p>This exercise can work great in conjunction with a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/blog\/general-dynamic-warm-up\/\">dynamic warm-up<\/a> because the players will already be in lines. It&#8217;s also good to have the players warm-up up a bit before going full speed. With this in mind, it may be best to have players perform a few rounds of dribbling at their own pace before breaking into competition mode.<\/p>\n[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]\n\n<span class=\"et_bloom_bottom_trigger\"><\/span>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Bayern Munich likes to do a variety of relay exercises in training for players to keep technical skills sharp.
