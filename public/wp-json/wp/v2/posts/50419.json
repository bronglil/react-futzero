You&#8217;ll need a goal keeper in the large goal. Divide players into two teams of six.<\/p>\n<p>This drill works especially well with coach&#8217;s who like to play with a back four system such as a 4-4-2, 4-2-3-1, or 4-3-3.<\/p>\n<p>The team defending the large goal sets up with a back four and two holding midfielders. The team attacking the large goal sets up with a striker, two wingers, and three central midfielders.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;4.2.2&#8243; text_font=&#8221;|300|||||||&#8221; text_text_color=&#8221;#151516&#8243; max_width=&#8221;70%&#8221; max_width_tablet=&#8221;&#8221; max_width_phone=&#8221;&#8221; max_width_last_edited=&#8221;on|desktop&#8221; module_alignment=&#8221;center&#8221; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243;]<\/p>\n<h3>How It Works<\/h3>\n<p>The team attacking the large goal starts with the ball and they work to break the defence down and score.<\/p>\n<p>In the event that the defenders win the ball, they can counter attack and try to score by dribbling or passing through the cones\/mini goals opposite them. The game proceeds as normal with the two teams going head to head. If the ball goes out of play a new ball can start up top with the attacking team.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;4.2.2&#8243; text_font=&#8221;|300|||||||&#8221; text_text_color=&#8221;#151516&#8243; max_width=&#8221;70%&#8221; max_width_tablet=&#8221;&#8221; max_width_phone=&#8221;&#8221; max_width_last_edited=&#8221;on|desktop&#8221; module_alignment=&#8221;center&#8221; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243;]<\/p>\n<h3>Coaching Points<\/h3>\n<p>Be sure that players are moving off the ball and offering good supporting angles in attack. This drill offers a great chance to work on combination play and working together to break down the defense.<\/p>\n<p>On the opposite side of the ball, defensive organization is very important and depending on a coaches tactics, either man to man or zonal defending can be used.<\/p>\n<p>Adapt this drill to suit your own tactical needs and don&#8217;t be afraid to pause the drill to make the coaching points you feel are relevant to help players learn.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n<span class=\"et_bloom_bottom_trigger\"><\/span>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>6v6 is a great size exercise to work on tactical concepts, especially when it comes to the back line and defensive midfielders against the attackers.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":50420,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_et_pb_use_builder":"on","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":""},"categories":[22,17],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/50419"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=50419"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/50419\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":50424,"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/50419\/revisions\/50424"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/50420"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=50419"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=50419"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.360player.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=50419"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
